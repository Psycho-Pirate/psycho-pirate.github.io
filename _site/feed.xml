        <description>
          
          Week 5 and 6 During these weeks, I started working on the remaining BOLT2. These included: test_bolt2-02-reestablish.py test_bolt2-10-add-htlc.py test_bolt2-20-open_channel_accepter.py test_bolt2-30-channel_type-open-accept-tlvs.py Out of these tests, the test_bolt2-20-open_channel_accepter.py is a bit flaky in CI and is marked to be skipped in pytest. The test_bolt2-30-channel_type-open-accept-tlvs.py is working with C-Lightning but needs to be...

          Week 9 and 10 Almost all the BOLT tests had passed except test_bolt2-30-channel_type-open-accept-tlvs.py. In the LDK logs, I received the following error Deserialization failed due to shortness of message. Even after carefully going through my LDK-Sample code and Lnprototest script, I was not able to determine what was causing this...

          Week 7 and 8 During these weeks, all the BOLT2 tests passed except test_bolt2-30-channel_type-open-accept-tlvs. I also started working on the BOLT7 tests. These included: test_bolt7-01-channel_announcement-success.py test_bolt7-02-channel_announcement-failure.py test_bolt7-10-gossip-filter.py test_bolt7-20-query_channel_range.py Out of these tests, the test_bolt7-10-gossip-filter.py and test_bolt7-20-query_channel_range.py require option_gossip_queries which LDK does not support. Hence these tests are skipped. All these...

          In this blog, I will talk about my experience in contributing to LDK and how a beginner contributer can get started. LightningDevKit Lightning Development Kit is a library that allows you to build a lightning node without worrying about implementing low-level lightning logic correctly. LDK is based on Rust-Lightning, a...

        <title>GSoC Week 11: Final Evaluation!</title>
        <description>
          
          During this week, I implemented all the remaining functions of Phase-3. These included plot_shear_stress(), max_shear_force(), max_bending_moment(), and max_deflection() functions. As this was the last week of GSoC, I also had to prepare a report stating all the work I did during summer. The report can be found here. plot_shear_stress() This...

        <title>GSoC Week 10: Phase 3 begins!</title>
        <description>
          
          During this week, I implemented the last part of Phase-2. These included solve_for_ild_moment() and plot_ild_moment() functions. The solve_for_ild_moment() function uses the solve_for_ild_reactions() function and calculates the I.L.D. equations for moment at a point specified by the user. The derived equations can then be plotted using the plot_ild_moment() function. solve_for_ild_moment() This...

          During this week, I implemented the solve_for_ild_shear() function. This function uses the solve_for_ild_reactions() function and calculates the I.L.D. equations for shear at a point specified by the user. The derived equations can then be plotted using the plot_ild_shear() function. solve_for_ild_shear() This function calculates the shear equations in terms of ‘x’....

        <title>GSoC Week 7 and 8: Back to Phase-2!</title>
        <description>
          
          These two weeks were spent on imploving the solve_for_ild_reactions() function and resolving the backwards incompatibility caused by the existing functions. After finding a decent solution, the functions were implemented and successfully merged. solve_for_ild_reactions() This function solves the reaction equations in terms of ‘x’. Here ‘x’ represents the distance of the...
