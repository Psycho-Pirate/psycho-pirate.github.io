During this week, I implemented the ```solve_for_ild_shear()``` function. This function uses the ```solve_for_ild_reactions()``` function and calculates the I.L.D. equations for shear at a point specified by the user. The derived equations can then be plotted using the ```plot_ild_shear()``` function.
<br>

# ```solve_for_ild_shear()```
This function calculates the shear equations in terms of ***'x'***. Here ***'x'*** represents the distance of the moving load from the origin.
Here is an example:
```
    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam
    >>> E, I = symbols('E, I')
    >>> R_0, R_8 = symbols('R_0, R_8')
    >>> b = Beam(12, E, I)
    >>> b.apply_support(0, 'roller')
    >>> b.apply_support(8, 'roller')
    >>> b.solve_for_ild_reactions(1, R_0, R_8)
    >>> b.solve_for_ild_shear(4, 1, R_0, R_8)
    >>> b.ild_shear
    Piecewise((x/8, x < 4), (x/8 - 1, x > 4))
``` 
<br>
# ```plot_ild_shear()```
This function plots the above solved equations
```
    >>> b.plot_ild_shear()
```

After this gets merged, I will push the last function of phase 2 as well.
