The second week of coding period ended. During this week, I simply implemented some minor changes suggested by the mentors. However, at the time of merging I faced a lot of merge conflicts as all my PRs made changes to the same file. After dealing with them, the PRs got merged and I am proud to announce that the phase-1 of my project is almost complete.<br>

# Few Results of Phase-1 

In phase-1, the functions I planned on adding were plotting functions for:
* Shear Force
* Bending Moment
* Slope
* Deflection
* All loading results<br>

Four of the above PRs have been successfully implemented and they got merged as well.
Here are some example plots that these functions show:<br>

```plot_shear_force()```

```plot_bending_moment()```

```plot_slope()```
<center><img src="/assets/img/gsoc/sl.png" alt="Slope" ></center><br>
```plot_deflection()```
<center><img src="/assets/img/gsoc/def.png" alt="Deflection" ></center><br>
I will be pushing the ```plot_loading_results()``` function which will display all the above graphs on a single plot.
I am pretty sure that the phase-1 will be completed and merged successfully by the end of the upcoming week.
