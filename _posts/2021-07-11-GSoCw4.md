During the 4th week, I made some changes to the last PR of phase-1 and it got merged successfully. The rest of the week was spent researching on the topics of Phase-2. This involved going through some books and reading through research papers.<br>

# Phase-2: Influence Line Diagrams 
In phase-2, I plan on adding some new functions to the Beam class. These include functions for:
* I.L.D. for reactions
* I.L.D. for shear
* I.L.D. for moment<br>
There will be two functions made for each of the above. These will include one function for calculating the equations and another for plotting them.<br>
<br>
# I.L.D. for reactions
During week 5, I implemented functions for I.L.D. for reactions. These included ```solve_for_ild_reactions()``` and ```plot_ild_reactions()```.<br>
The ```solve_for_ild_reactions()``` calculates the reaction equations caused by the effect of a moving load.<br>
The ```plot_ild_reactions()``` simply plots them.<br>
Here's an example:

I have received some feedback on these PRs and after implementing the suggested changes, they will most probably get merged by the end of the upcoming week.
