This blog will serve as a project report for my **Summer of Bitcoin** project with **LDK**. My project focuses on integrating **LDK** which is lightning network implementation with the **Lnprototest** test suite.

# Lnprototest 
[Lnprototest](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest) is a set of test helpers written in Python3, designed to make it easy to write new tests when you propose changes to the lightning network protocol, as well as test existing implementations.

Tests are simply a list of `Events`, like `Msg` to send a message and `ExpectMsg` to receive a response. But the tool goes much further: `TryAll` indicates multiple different variants should all be attempted, such as running the test with different features or trying reconnection in the middle of the test.
It also has `Events` to create commitment transactions, add and remove HTLCs, and other things youâ€™d expect. 

Testers can also write their own custom Events for more specialized testing and Events can be conditional on what features were negotiated or other runtime behavior.

# LDK
[Lightning Development Kit](https://lightningdevkit.org/) is a library that allows you to build a lightning node without worrying about implementing low-level lightning logic correctly.

**LDK** is based on Rust-Lightning, a full-featured but also incredibly flexible lightning implementation designed to be modular and customizable. It allows you to build a lightning node without having to worry about all of the low-level lightning logic like the state machine or routing.

# The project
In order to integrate **LDK** with **Lnprototest**, few things should be kept in mind.
* **LDK** is not a node, its a lightning implementation that can be used to create a node.
* In order to integrate with **Lnprototest**, we need a node implemented using **LDK**.
* For these reasons, I will be using **LDK-Sample**.

[LDK-Sample](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample) is a sample node implementation which uses **LDK**.

In order to integrate it with **Lnprototest**, some changes are required in **LDK-Sample** and a `ldk.py` script is needed in **Lnprototest**. This script will contain a ldk runner class which will act as a middleman between **Lnprototest** and **LDK-Sample**.

This class consists of various functions which need to be implemented for ensuring proper functionality.

# Progress Made
* Implementing `features.rs` in **LDK-Sample**. This file simply displays the features of **LDK-Sample** node. These features are then used by the `ldk.py` script inside **Lnprototest**.
* Adding an exit function in **LDK-Sample**. Having an exit function ensures that the port used by **LDK-Sample** is unoccupied after the node is exited and can be used for other purposes.
* Implementing `myKeysManager` struct in **LDK-Sample**. This struct manages the node secrets and uses a `key_seed` to generate different keys. The advantage of using this instead of the default `KeysManager` is that it allows me to use my own set of channel secrets(funding_key, revocation_base_key, payment_key, delayed_payment_base_key, htlc_base_key) instead of the randomly generated ones. This was useful for setting up the configuration required by **Lnprototest**.
* Implementing `KeysInterface` trait for the `myKeysManager` struct. This was essential for `myKeysManager` as it has a lot of useful methods.
* Implementing `openchannel_test` method in **LDK-Sample**. This method allows opening a fundchannel without providing the host or port.
* Adding the `ldk.py` script inside **Lnprototest**. This script does all the heavy lifting in the integration process.
* Implementing the `LDKConn` class inside the script. This class is used to connect to the node using `pyln.proto.wire` module and intercept all the messages that the node initiates and receives.
* Implementing the `LDK Runner` class. This class contains all the functions used to start/stop bitcoind, start/stop **LDK-Sample** node, adding a connection, connecting to a peer, carrying out transactions, receiving output messages etc. The tests are run against this class and it basically tells the node to do a particular task(like connecting to a peer) and the `LDKConn` class intercepts the messages sent by the node. The various methods I have implemented are:
	*	```__init__```
	*	```__init_sandbox_dir```
	*	```get_keyset```
	*	```get_node_privkey```
	*	```get_node_bitcoinkey```
	*	```is_running```
	*	```start```
	*	```shutdown```
	*	```stop```
	*	```def restart```
	*	```connect```
	*	```getblockheight```
	*	```trim_blocks```
	*	```add_blocks```
	*	```recv```
	*	```fundchannel```
	*	```get_output_message```
	*	```check_error```
	*	```check_final_error```
	*	```expect_tx```
	*	```expect_tx```
	*	```has_option```
* I have also started some testing with the `BOLT` tests. The LDK implementation follows all the `BOLT` specifications but `BOLT#1` and `BOLT#2` tests are failing because of a bug in **Lnprototest** for which I opened an [issue](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/issues/57).

I haven't made any pull requests to the main repos as I would like to finish the entire project before merging it.
However, my work can be found in my forked repos.

# Remaining work
* Finishing the `ldk.py` script. There are some functions in the `LDK runner` class that need to be implemented. These include:
	*	```init_rbf```
	*	```invoice```
	*	```accept_add_fund```
	*	```addhtlc```
* Testing against the `BOLT` Specification tests and improving the script as required.

The end goal of this project is to ensure that the script works perfectly and all the tests pass.
The **LDK** community has been really helpful to me during this time. All the developers are friendly and have supported me extensively through my journey. I would like to thank my mentor [Conor Okus](https://github.com/ConorOkus) for always being there for me and guiding me. I would also like to thank [Matt Corallo](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jeffrey Czyz](https://github.com/jkczyz) and [Vincenzo Palazzo](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo) for entertaining my silly questions.
