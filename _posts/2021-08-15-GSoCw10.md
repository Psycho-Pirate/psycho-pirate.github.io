During this week, I implemented the last part of Phase-2. These included ```solve_for_ild_moment()``` and ```plot_ild_moment()``` functions. The ```solve_for_ild_moment()``` function uses the ```solve_for_ild_reactions()``` function and calculates the I.L.D. equations for moment at a point specified by the user. The derived equations can then be plotted using the ```plot_ild_moment()``` function.
<br>

# ```solve_for_ild_moment()```
This function calculates the moment equations in terms of ***'x'***. Here ***'x'*** represents the distance of the moving load from the origin.
Here is an example:
```
    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam
    >>> E, I = symbols('E, I')
    >>> R_0, R_8 = symbols('R_0, R_8')
    >>> b = Beam(12, E, I)
    >>> b.apply_support(0, 'roller')
    >>> b.apply_support(8, 'roller')
    >>> b.solve_for_ild_reactions(1, R_0, R_8)
    >>> b.solve_for_ild_moment(4, 1, R_0, R_8)
    >>> b.ild_moment
    Piecewise((-x/2, x < 4), (x/2 - 4, x > 4))
``` 
<br>
# ```plot_ild_moment()```
This function plots the above solved equations
```
    >>> b.plot_ild_moment()
```

With this PR, Phase-2 ends. I have started working on Phase-3 functions. These include plotting function for shear stress in Beam class and Beam3D class and functions to find max shear force, bending moment and deflection in Beam3D class. Hopefully Phase-3 will get completed by the end of the next week.
