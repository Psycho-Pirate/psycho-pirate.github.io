# Week 7 and 8
During these weeks, all the BOLT2 tests passed except `test_bolt2-30-channel_type-open-accept-tlvs`. I also started working on the BOLT7 tests. These included:
* test_bolt7-01-channel_announcement-success.py
* test_bolt7-02-channel_announcement-failure.py
* test_bolt7-10-gossip-filter.py
* test_bolt7-20-query_channel_range.py
<br>

Out of these tests, the `test_bolt7-10-gossip-filter.py` and `test_bolt7-20-query_channel_range.py` require `option_gossip_queries` which LDK does not support. Hence these tests are skipped.
<br>

All these tests just needed the right set of features to be sent by Lnprototest to LDK. Therefore I used the previousely implemented method `runner_features` to send the right set of features. I opened another [pull request](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/pull/99) for updating these tests. This made the tests pass.
<br>

After this, all the BOLT7 tests passed.
