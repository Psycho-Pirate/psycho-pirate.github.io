# Week 9 and 10
Almost all the BOLT tests had passed except `test_bolt2-30-channel_type-open-accept-tlvs.py`. In the LDK logs, I received the following error ```Deserialization failed due to shortness of message```. 
<br>

Even after carefully going through my LDK-Sample code and Lnprototest script, I was not able to determine what was causing this error. I inferred that there might be a bug in the current LDK version `0.0.115`, however I couldn't determine exactly what it was. 
<br>

Vincenzo tried running the test with his lightning node based on LDK `0.0.116` and the tests passed. Hence I updated my LDK-Sample to use `0.0.116`. This required tweaking some structs that were updated in the new release. After successfully updating LDK-Sample, the test passed. 
<br>

With this, all the tests were passing.
