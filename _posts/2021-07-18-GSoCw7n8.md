These two weeks were spent on imploving the ```solve_for_ild_reactions()``` function and resolving the backwards incompatibility caused by the existing functions. After finding a decent solution, the functions were implemented and successfully merged. 
<br>

# ```solve_for_ild_reactions()```
This function solves the reaction equations in terms of ***'x'***. Here ***'x'*** represents the distance of the moving load from the origin.
Here is an example:
```
    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam
    >>> E, I = symbols('E, I')
    >>> R_0, R_7 = symbols('R_0, R_7')
    >>> b = Beam(10, E, I)
    >>> b.apply_support(0, 'roller')
    >>> b.apply_support(7, 'roller')
    >>> b.apply_load(5,4,-1)
    >>> b.solve_for_ild_reactions(1,R_0,R_7)
    >>> b.ild_reactions
        {R_0: x/7 - 22/7, R_7: -x/7 - 20/7}
``` 
<br>
# ```plot_ild_reactions()```
This function plots the above solved equations
```
    >>> b.plot_ild_reactions()
```

I also implemented all the remaining functions of phase 2 on my machine. I will be pushing them in the upcoming week.
