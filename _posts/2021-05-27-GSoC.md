The results of GSoC 2021 were declared the previous week and I am really excited to announce that my proposal was accepted by SymPy.

I would simply put this as verbatim from Google's site, *‘‘
Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 10 week programming project during their break from school.’’*

Here is a short video by Google Developers' YouTube Channel explaining what Google Summer of Code program is about.

# About the organisation
SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.

I have been contributing to Sympy for over an year now and have been actively developing the __Continuum Mechanics__ module.<br>
# My Proposal
The continuum mechanics of Sympy is in its early stage of development. During
this summer, I plan on adding the following features:
* Adding plotting functions in Beam 3D class for
	* Shear Force
	* Bending Moment
	* Slope
	* Deflection
	* All loading results
* Adding support for calculating equations of Influence Line Diagrams for
	* Reactions
	* Shear Force
	* Bending Moment
* Adding functions to plot the above Influence Line Diagrams
* Adding functions for max deflection, bending moment, and shear in Beam
3D class

Here is my [GSoC Proposal](https://github.com/Psycho-Pirate/GSoC-21-).

I am really looking forward to working with this amazing community of developers and I hope this summer turns out to be as productive as I have planned it to be!
