Hello, World! I am Anudit Verma, a Computer Science Graduate Student at California State University Long Beach. And today, I am very proud and excited to share my journey on becoming a Google Developer Student Club (DSC) Lead for the year 2020-21.

Also, I would like to mention that I am sharing my experience in the form of a blog. Blogs can be powerful things, and they give even a small somebody like me a chance to speak with the entire world as an audience. 

So before I dive into the nitty-gritty of my DSC experience, I wanted to share a few words of wisdom. This is coming from an individual who is just a speck in the Universe and wants to create a monumental impact in life, perhaps a dent in the Universe. But ours is a small world and you need to set a few things in life just about right to do so. But please don't get worried if things are not going your way. The important part is that you should keep trying and keep going. I am not a philosopher. I believe you should create your philosophies. Why? Because your story is different. Although, there is one thing in life that you can do and will remain the same for all of us. Dream.
