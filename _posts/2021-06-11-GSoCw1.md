The community bonding period of GSoC ended recently and the official coding period has started from 7th June 2021. During the community bonding period, I got in touch with my mentors, [Ishan Joshi](https://github.com/ishanaj) and [Nikhil Maan](https://github.com/Sc0rpi0n101). All three of us share an engineering background and coincidently, live in the same city as well.<br>
After few discussions with my mentors, I have started working on the phase-1 of my project.

# PHASE-1: Building Plotting functions for Beam3D Class
The Phase 1 of my project is simply what the title suggests. The Beam3D class lacked any plotting functions and I plan on implementing them, similar to the ones present in the existing Beam Class. 
The functions I plan on adding include plotting functions for:
* Shear Force
* Bending Moment
* Slope
* Deflection
* All loading results

I had already implemented a function for plotting shear force before GSoC and it was approved and merged by the mentors. Hence, I already have a basic idea on how to implement the rest of them and I know exactly how the organisation wants them coded.<br>

I made good use of the time provided during the community bonding period and started working on the code from the community bonding period itself. At the time of writing this blog, I have already made three Pull Requests viz. [Bending Moment](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21582), [Slope](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21583), and [Deflection](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21593).<br>

I haven't pushed the ```plot_loading_results()``` function as it depends on the above three PRs. I am waiting for the developers' approval on the above PRs and I hope they get merged soon.<br>
If everything goes as planned, the Phase-1 of my project will be completed by the end of next week.
