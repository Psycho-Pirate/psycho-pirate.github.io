### Week 11 and 12
During these weeks, I wrote a docker script for running these tests as part of Continuous Integration. This allowed the tests to be run as a Github Action after every push. This can be found [here.](https://github.com/Psycho-Pirate/lnprototest/blob/test_with_script/docker/Dockerfile.ldk)

# Project Report<br><br>
### Lnprototest 
[Lnprototest](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest) is a set of test helpers written in Python3, designed to make it easy to write new tests when you propose changes to the lightning network protocol, as well as test existing implementations.

Tests are simply a list of `Events`, like `Msg` to send a message and `ExpectMsg` to receive a response. But the tool goes much further: `TryAll` indicates multiple different variants should all be attempted, such as running the test with different features or trying reconnection in the middle of the test.
It also has `Events` to create commitment transactions, add and remove HTLCs, and other things youâ€™d expect. 

Testers can also write their own custom Events for more specialized testing and Events can be conditional on what features were negotiated or other runtime behavior.

### LDK
[Lightning Development Kit](https://lightningdevkit.org/) is a library that allows you to build a lightning node without worrying about implementing low-level lightning logic correctly.

<br>
<br>
**LDK** is based on Rust-Lightning, a full-featured but also incredibly flexible lightning implementation designed to be modular and customizable. It allows you to build a lightning node without having to worry about all of the low-level lightning logic like the state machine or routing.

### The project
In order to integrate **LDK** with **Lnprototest**, few things should be kept in mind.
* **LDK** is not a node, its a lightning implementation that can be used to create a node.
* In order to integrate with **Lnprototest**, we need a node implemented using **LDK**.
* For these reasons, I will be using **LDK-Sample**.

[LDK-Sample](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample) is a sample node implementation which uses **LDK**.

In order to integrate it with **Lnprototest**, some changes are required in **LDK-Sample** and a `ldk.py` script is needed in **Lnprototest**. This script will contain a ldk runner class which will act as a middleman between **Lnprototest** and **LDK-Sample**.

This class consists of various functions which need to be implemented for ensuring proper functionality.

### Progress Made
* Implementing `myKeysManager` struct in **LDK-Sample**. This struct manages the node secrets and generates custom keys. The advantage of using this instead of the default `KeysManager` is that it allows me to use my own set of channel secrets(funding_key, revocation_base_key, payment_key, delayed_payment_base_key, htlc_base_key) instead of the randomly generated ones. This was useful for setting up the configuration required by **Lnprototest**.
* Implementing `KeysInterface` trait for the `myKeysManager` struct. This was essential for `myKeysManager` as it has a lot of useful methods.
* Implementing `openchannel_without_peer_addr` method in **LDK-Sample**. This method allows opening a fundchannel without providing the host or port.
* Adding the `ldk.py` script inside **Lnprototest**. This script does all the heavy lifting in the integration process.
* Implementing the `LDKConn` class inside the script. This class is used to connect to the node using `pyln.proto.wire` module and intercept all the messages that the node initiates and receives.
* Implementing the `LDK Runner` class. This class contains all the functions used to start/stop bitcoind, start/stop **LDK-Sample** node, adding a connection, connecting to a peer, carrying out transactions, receiving output messages etc. The tests are run against this class and it basically tells the node to do a particular task(like connecting to a peer) and the `LDKConn` class intercepts the messages sent by the node. 
* Testing the `BOLT` tests present inside Lnprototest. This included a total of 45 tests.
* Updating the tests so that they are compatible with other implementations apart from C-Lightning.
* Introducing new methods like `runner_features` which helps with cross compatibility.
* Ensuring that all the tests pass.
* Writing a docker script to include LDK runner as part of Github Continuous Integration.

# Conclusion
The project is completed and all tests are running successfully. Only merging to the main repos is pending. Through this project, I am happy to conclude that LDK is incredibly **robust** and **spec compliant**. 
<br>
Throughout this project, I did not find any spec related bug in LDK which simply showcases the phenomenal work LDK Developers have done over the years. 
<br>
<br>
The **LDK** community has been really helpful to me during this time. All the developers are friendly and have supported me extensively through my journey. I would like to thank my mentor [Conor Okus](https://github.com/ConorOkus) for always being there for me and guiding me. I would also like to thank [Matt Corallo](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jeffrey Czyz](https://github.com/jkczyz) for entertaining my silly questions.<br> A special thanks to [Vincenzo Palazzo](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo) for solving my complex queries and steering me towards the right path.
