During this week, I pushed the last function of phase-1, ```plot_loading_results()```.
This function displays all the graphs of the other functions on a single plot. After making some changes suggested by the mentors, the PR is ready to merge and phase-1 is finally over.<br>

# plot_loading_results() 

This function was made similar to the function present in the Beam Class of the same name. It simply takes the direction as an argument and plots all the graphs (shear force, bending moment, slope, and deflection) on a single plot along the direction specified.<br>
Here is an example of what it looks like:<br>

```plot_loading_results()```

With this PR, Phase-1 is completed from my side and the successful merging of this PR will mark the end of Phase-1.
