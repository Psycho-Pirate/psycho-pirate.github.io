The first evaluation of GSoC occured this week and I am happy to announce that I have successfully passed it. The mentors also left an amazing feedback of my work.

# I.L.D. for reactions
This week was spent on further refining the ```solve_for_ild_reactions()``` and ```plot_ild_reactions()``` to accomodate the changes suggested by the mentors. The resulting plots are inverted with respect to the actual plots but this was done intentionally to make sure that the plots are in accordance with the sign convention chosen by the user. There are still some issues left but they will be resolved after some discussion.

I also implemented the functions for **I.L.D. for Shear** on my machine. These functions will be pushed after the previous ones get merged to avoid any merge conflicts.
