# Week 3 and 4

During these weeks, I started working on the BOLT2 tests. These included:
	* test_bolt2-01-close_channel.py
	* test_bolt2-01-open_channel.py
	* test_bolt2-02-reestablish.py
	* test_bolt2-10-add-htlc.py
	* test_bolt2-20-open_channel_accepter.py
	* test_bolt2-30-channel_type-open-accept-tlvs.py
<br>
<br>
I tried running the `open_channel` and `close_channel` tests. They were failing for a variety of reasons. I added `fundchannel`, `_fundchannel`, `_done` methods in the LDK script which can be used to interact with LDK-Sample to open a fund channel. I also had to tweak LDK-Sample as the `open_channel` method used in LDK-Sample required both peer pubkey and its address. I created another method which only uses peer pubkey to open a fundchannel.
<br>
<br>
I also added `kill_fundchannel` method in the LDK script. After this, the script side was working fine but the tests were still failing. This was happening because the tests were too specific to C-Lightning. 
For example:
	* `minimum_depth` was set to `3` in every `accept_channel` message.
	* The number of Blocks to be mined was set to `3` as well. 
	* `dust_limit_satoshis` was set to 546.
	* `htlc_minimum_msat` was set to 0.
	* `to_self_delay` was set to 6.
<br>
<br>
These were fixed after Vincenzo introduced a `stash` which stores these fields from messages returned by lightning implementations in this [pull request](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/pull/85). The above mentioned fields can be retrieved from the stash. I used the stash wherever necessary in the `open_channel` and `close_channel` tests to make Lnprototest cross compatible. 
<br>
<br>
Here are the pull requests and issues raised.
	* [Issue #86](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/issues/86)
	* [PR #89](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/pull/89)
	* [PR #90](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/pull/90)
	* [Pr #92](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/pull/92)
<br>
<br>
After this the `open_channel` and `close_channel` passed successfully. These included four tests:
* `test_open_channel_announce_features`
* `test_open_channel_from_accepter_side`
* `test_open_channel_opener_side`
* `test_close_channel_shutdown_msg_normal_case_receiver_side`

<br>
Now I will work on the remaining BOLT#2 tests.
